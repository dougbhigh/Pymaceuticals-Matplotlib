# PymaceuticalsMatplotlib
          Analyze fictitious data on anti-cancer (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)) treatment study of mice and
          create various charts showing metrics of study groups and efficiency of treatment.
     > Merge .csv files and clean data.
     > Create summary chart of tumor size statistics for all 10 treatments (including placebo).
     > Bar graph of mice per study group.
     > Pie chart of sex distribution.
     > Boxplot with outliers of ending tumor size for select treatment groups.
     > Summarize inner quartile values, possible outlier ranges, and potential outliers.
     > Generate line plot of random mouse showing tumor size throughout full study.
     > Create scatterplot with regression line and function for select treatment comparing mouse weight vs. 
       tumor size.
